Vicinity File Drop A solution to eradicate the use of pen-drives, hard disks and other storage devices in order to transfer data between devices in close proximity using Wi-Fi.Initially, an Ad-hoc network is set up and the nodes that are in vicinity (within Wi-Fi range of each other) are identified.The file is encrypted at the sender's side and sent and is decrypted at the receiver's side.The encryption/decryption is done using the AES algorithm and other security issues like Spoofing, Sybil attack are reduced in the application.The data is sent much faster and in a secure manner with an easy-to-use interface Mini - Projects Network Sniffer\\\" Created an application using C# that gives the information of all packets being transmitted over the network that are using TCP or UDP.The captured information is decoded from raw digital form into a human-readable format that permits users of the application to easily review the exchanged information.The Network Sniffer monitors the network and it measures the amount and type of traffic on the particular network.Information is extracted from packet headers and displayed on the basis of user settings such as filters, time, etc.Development of an Air Traffic Control System\\\" Created an interface for the air traffic controller that manages all landing, taking off and passing-by flights in the given air space using Visual Basic as the front end and created the database in Oracle for fast query retrieval.The system automatically transfers the control of the flight from the air controller to the ground controller once the flight has landed to be directed to the correct parking bay and vice versa when the flight is ready to take off.Performance of String Search Algorithms on Heterogeneous Computing (CPU/GPU) platforms\\\" Implemented two algorithms namely, Brute Force and Boyer-Moore using normal conventional programming and tested the performance of each.Attempted to implement the same using CUDA on the GPU platform and found that the Boyer Moore execution is much faster and can be parallelized to a greater extent.Major Achievements: Gold Medalist of the university in the Information Technology branch for securing the 1st rank amongst more than 300 students.Represented the college in an international coding contest \\\"IEEE Xtreme\\\" and was ranked amongst the top 500 teams in the world.The online contest was held across the globe for a period of 24 hours and was organized by the IEEE professional association.Participated in the \\\"ACM ICPC\\\" (International Collegiate Programming Contest) Regional Contest in the Asia region, organized by the ACM professional association.Secured 1st place in a hacking contest \\\"Crack-o-Hack\\\" organized by the CSI Regional Student Convention.Won the 1st Prize (Gold Medal) in a Computer Science Competition in Standard 11 for the project, \\\"Learn Trigonometry on the Mobile\\\" in the year 2006.\\nEducationExpected in2012totoB-Tech|Information Technology,,GPA:Information TechnologyExpected intoto|Gold Medalist of University,,GPA:GPA: 86 GPA: 9.46Expected in2008toto|Nowrosjee Wadia College of Science,,GPA:Expected in2006totoDegree Institute/School City Year Grades|Vidya Bhavan High School,,GPA:\\nSkillsbig data, Business Intelligence, C++, encryption, Data Management, Data transfer, Java, JSP, Javascript, machine learning, microprocessor, C#, Oracle, SQL, Visual Basic\",\"job_description_text\":\"We are looking for an energetic and talented tax accountant to be part of our team.

Methods, Security and Applications\\\" in an International Conference \\\"Advances in Computer and Communication Technology\\\" held in Mumbai conducted by the IETE.Projects Done: Final Year Project - Vicinity File Drop A solution to eradicate the use of pen-drives, hard disks and other storage devices in order to transfer data between devices in close proximity using Wi-Fi.Initially, an Ad-hoc network is set up and the nodes that are in vicinity (within Wi-Fi range of each other) are identified.The file is encrypted at the sender's side and sent and is decrypted at the receiver's side.The encryption/decryption is done using the AES algorithm and other security issues like Spoofing, Sybil attack are reduced in the application.The data is sent much faster and in a secure manner with an easy-to-use interface Mini - Projects Network Sniffer\\\" Created an application using C# that gives the information of all packets being transmitted over the network that are using TCP or UDP.The captured information is decoded from raw digital form into a human-readable format that permits users of the application to easily review the exchanged information.The Network Sniffer monitors the network and it measures the amount and type of traffic on the particular network.Information is extracted from packet headers and displayed on the basis of user settings such as filters, time, etc.Development of an Air Traffic Control System\\\" Created an interface for the air traffic controller that manages all landing, taking off and passing-by flights in the given air space using Visual Basic as the front end and created the database in Oracle for fast query retrieval.The system automatically transfers the control of the flight from the air controller to the ground controller once the flight has landed to be directed to the correct parking bay and vice versa when the flight is ready to take off.Performance of String Search Algorithms on Heterogeneous Computing (CPU/GPU) platforms\\\" Implemented two algorithms namely, Brute Force and Boyer-Moore using normal conventional programming and tested the performance of each.Attempted to implement the same using CUDA on the GPU platform and found that the Boyer Moore execution is much faster and can be parallelized to a greater extent.Major Achievements: Gold Medalist of the university in the Information Technology branch for securing the 1st rank amongst more than 300 students.Represented the college in an international coding contest \\\"IEEE Xtreme\\\" and was ranked amongst the top 500 teams in the world.The online contest was held across the globe for a period of 24 hours and was organized by the IEEE professional association.Participated in the \\\"ACM ICPC\\\" (International Collegiate Programming Contest) Regional Contest in the Asia region, organized by the ACM professional association.Secured 1st place in a hacking contest \\\"Crack-o-Hack\\\" organized by the CSI Regional Student Convention.Won the 1st Prize (Gold Medal) in a Computer Science Competition in Standard 11 for the project, \\\"Learn Trigonometry on the Mobile\\\" in the year 2006.\\nEducationExpected in2012totoB-Tech|Information Technology,,GPA:Information TechnologyExpected intoto|Gold Medalist of University,,GPA:GPA: 86 GPA: 9.46Expected in2008toto|Nowrosjee Wadia College of Science,,GPA:Expected in2006totoDegree Institute/School City Year Grades|Vidya Bhavan High School,,GPA:\\nSkillsbig data, Business Intelligence, C++, encryption, Data Management, Data transfer, Java, JSP, Javascript, machine learning, microprocessor, C#, Oracle, SQL, Visual Basic\",\"job_description_text\":\"Significant Responsibilities: Capital call and distribution calculation and review, including follow-up with Accounting Manager Prepare journal entries and all supporting sub-ledgers (GAAP and Tax) Prepare quarterly and year-end financial statements Prepare investment schedule; obtain legal documentation for all investmentsdisposals Document investment activity details in well-written memos Prepare workpapersconfirmations for external audit Develop and maintain relationships with key bank and legal professionals Assist other members of the team as necessary Qualifications: 2+ years of public accounting experience or private accounting experience Private equity exposure is not required but is beneficial Bachelors degree in Accounting or Finance Exceptionally organized and detail oriented Ability to multi-task and prioritize Solid communication skills Highly motivated and eager to learn Work well in a group Willingness to take on additional projects and tasks to facilitate a team environment\",\"label\":\"No Fit\"},\"truncated_cells\":[]},{\"row_idx\":59,\"row\":{\"resume_text\":\"Professional BackgroundCertified Coding Specialists (CCS) with E/M, outpatient, in patient/ER admits, diagnostic, procedural /pro fee Coding, CMS-DRG, VBP, CPT II codes, HEDIS, HCC, RAF, data analyst and quality auditing in health management programs, ICD 10 Certified.  5 Years experience in Administration/ Office management and as Coding/billing manager.
